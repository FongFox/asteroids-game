# Asteroids with Pygame

A small project to get familiar with `pygame` and the basic structure of a Python game program.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- `pygame` (managed via `uv` in `pyproject.toml`)

## Setup

Install dependencies with:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Running the program

- Run the main script with:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

- If everything is working, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Starting Asteroids with pygame version: 2.6.1
```

## Project structure

- `main.py` – Entry point of the program, imports `pygame` and prints its version.
- `pyproject.toml` – Project and dependency configuration.
- `uv.lock` – Lockfile generated by `uv` to pin dependency versions.
- `.python-version` – Specifies the Python version used for this project.

## Notes

- This is just the initial boilerplate to verify that `pygame` is installed and working.
- Future steps will gradually add the actual Asteroids game logic and rendering.
